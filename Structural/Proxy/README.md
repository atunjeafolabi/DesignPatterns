Proxy
-----
Have you ever used an access card to go through a door? There are multiple options to open that door i.e. it can be opened either using access card or by pressing a button that bypasses the security. The door's main functionality is to open but there is a proxy added on top of it to add some functionality.

In plain words

Using the proxy pattern, a class represents the functionality of another class.
